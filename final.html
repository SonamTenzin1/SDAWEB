      <p class="text">
        Hi!! I am an undergraduate Software Engineering  
        student at College of Science and Technology based
        in Rinchending, Phuntsholing, Chhukha and my name 
        is Sonam Tenzin. I have always been passionate about
        technology, and I love learning more about it.

       <br/>
       My father taught me how to use a computer  since I was in pre-primary and throughout my academic career, I have gained valuable knowledge about IT. 
       <br/>
       
       <br/>
       
       <br/>
       When I'm not busy with assignments, you can find me in online games such as Mobile Legends and Apex Legends. I am a firm believer of ‘Never give in, even at the cost of blood’, and I strive for personal growth.
       <br/>
       
       <br/>
       
       <br/>
       I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities.
